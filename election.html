                       <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">If the paid up share capital of the said society is more than Rs. 10, 000, the voting is conducted by secret ballot.</h6><br>
                        <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">At the time of the voting, each member is shown an empty ballot box before they cast their vote. The Ballot Paper usually has the seal of the society and the counterfoil the initials of the Returning Officer. The Ballot Box is sealed in front of the voters and all the documents/votes relevant to the Election are stored safely by the Secretary who is required to preserve them for three months and then destroy them afterwards. This is done in case of disputes.</h6><br>
                          <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">After the results, the current committee hands over the charge to the newly elected committee.</h6><br>
                            <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">In summary, timely execution of required procedures is quite essential to carry out an Election successfully. At each step of the way, the members need clarity and transparency from the elected members . At the same time, members need to be proactively involved in the election procedures as it is commonly observed in many housing societies that the same individuals are selected as office bearers in every term. This may lead to lethargy, inefficiency, or malfeasance in many cases.</h6><br>

                 <h4 style=" color: var(--e-global-color-vamtam_accent_6); text-align: justify;" class="my-3">Important points to note regarding housing society elections</h4>

                 <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Equal voting right: In general, each member of the housing society who owns a property has equal voting rights. In general, a member with a larger flat, say 3BHK, does not have a higher voting weightage than someone with a smaller flat, say 2BHK. A person who owns two flats in the society, on the other hand, gets two votes. Votes are usually cast based on the number of units rather than the number of members. In exceptional societies formed as limited liability companies rather than cooperatives, voting rights vary depending on the size of the unit. The Right2Vote eVoting platform allows you to create all types of elections, including those with weightage based on the number of units and weightage based on the size of the flat.</h6><br>

                  <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Voting rights of owners: All members of the housing society who own property have the right to vote. No member should be denied the right to vote. In most cases, the first owner has the right to vote, but co-owners may be allowed to vote as well.</h6><br>
                    <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Denial of voting rights: A bylaw may state that members who have not paid their society dues in full may be denied voting rights.</h6><br>
                      <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Tenant voting rights: In general, tenants do not have voting rights. Each flat’s voting rights are limited to the flat’s owner.</h6><br>
                        <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Voting window: To vote, a voter must be given a reasonable voting window. Keeping a very short voting window is restrictive and may lead to members complaining that their right to vote was denied. We recommend a minimum voting window of 8 hours if all of your voters are in India, and a minimum of 24 hours if your members are located outside of India to account for different time zones. In general, many societies keep a voting window of less than 2 hours, which can lead to legal issues.</h6><br>
                          <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Reasonable notice of election date and voting window: All voters should be given advance notice of the elections. In general, a minimum of 14 days advance notice is required. However, depending on the bye law, it can vary from society to society.</h6><br>
                            <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Intimation of election date and process: A society must notify its members in advance of its intention to hold elections and solicit nominations for various positions. This is usually done at least 21 days before the election date. The rules and procedures for nomination and election must also be distributed by the society.
                              Right to stand in elections: All owners/members have the same right to vote in elections. No owner can be denied the right to vote unless:
                              the owner’s title to the property is in dispute.
                              The owner has not paid all of the society’s dues.</h6><br>


                              <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Election method: The Acts or model bye laws have generally been silent on the election method, so both paper-based voting and online voting can be used. A show of hands is generally not recommended, especially when a’secret ballot’ is required. More information on this topic can be found on this blog..</h6><br>
                                <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Secret ballot: Most State Cooperative Acts and model bylaws state that members should be elected by secret ballot. Nobody, not even the election officer, should be able to tell which members voted for which candidates using a secret ballot. This is to ensure secrecy of member’s vote so that member can vote with his free will and there is no chance of coercion.</h6><br>
                                  <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Proxy voting: The majority of Acts and model bylaws state that “members should vote in person.” This means that proxy voting is not permitted. It should not be confused with the requirement of voter physical presence. It simply means that a voter cannot delegate his or her voting rights and responsibilities to someone else. Proxy voting clauses differ from society to society; please carefully review your bylaws for the same..</h6><br>
                                    <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Postal voting: Many Acts and bye-laws expressly provide for postal voting, in which members can vote by mail. However, due to election deadlines, postal voting is generally not feasible, and online voting is a preferred option for voters who live elsewhere or are traveling.</h6><br>
      
                                    <h6 class="nmn " style="text-align: justify;" class="my-4">Election of Committee Members: Rules differ in model byelaws relating to election of committee members. In a few states, such as West Bengal, members vote to elect committee members, and the committee members decide who will hold the titles of President, Treasurer, Secretary, and so on. Members in other states, such as Karnataka, vote directly to appoint specific candidates to positions such as President, Treasurer, Secretary, and so on. Members in other states, such as Karnataka, vote directly to appoint specific candidates to positions such as President, Treasurer, Secretary, and so on. A few members are also elected to the committee. Right2Vote’s eVoting platform includes ‘Team Election – Exact’ and ‘Team Election – Upto’ features to assist societies in electing a team of committee members from the same list of candidates. Check your bylaws to see if voters can choose an exact number of candidates or if they can choose fewer than the number of positions. Both customizations are available on the Right2Vote platform. This feature is not available on the majority of other platforms.</h6><br>
