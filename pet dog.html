  dog/pet in a housing society. To ensure that community living is not hampered in any way, there are certain
   pet rules in a housing society that residents must follow. To start off, the Animal Welfare Board of India has
    passed certain dog laws to ensure our furry companions are not harassed or treated unfairly. Both pet owners 
    and the management must be aware of laws for pet owners living in apartments. These dog laws and awareness about 
    pet rights help to keep the housing society functions smoothly. This 
  article takes an in-depth look at the pet rules in housing society in India.</h6> <br>

                       <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;">Ensure you give your pet ample obedience

                              pet is suffering from any illness. When your housing society organises vaccination or sterilisation drives for strays,

                            so make sure your pet is toilet trained. It is advisable for pet owners to clean up after their furry pal, 
                            if he/she has an accident inside the society premises, even if it is not required by law. It is also advisable
                             to maintain the hygiene of your pet for their own well-being and so no one is inconvenienced. In case, you feed strays make 
                            sure there are no leftovers once the strays have had their fill.</h6> <br>

                            <h4 style=" color: var(--e-global-color-vamtam_accent_6);" class="my-3">6. Supervise your pet</h4>

                            <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;">Even if your pet is well-trained, it is necessary to 
                              supervise your pet when in common spaces. Keep your pets on a leash when you take them out for a walk
                               or when they are playing around children to ensure safety. Ensure your pet is not aggressive or hostile towards
                               strays or other animals in the vicinity.  </h6> <br>
     
                             <h4 style=" color: var(--e-global-color-vamtam_accent_6);" class="my-3">7. Be a responsible pet owner</h4>

                             <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;">Make sure your pets get ample exercise, so they are not excessively
                               energetic. If your pet is alone for long hours, make sure she/he has ample food, water, and toys. Make sure they do not create 
                              a nuisance in your absence. </h6> <br>


                              <h2 style=" color: var(--e-global-color-vamtam_accent_6); ">What laws govern stray dogs in India? </h2><br>

                              <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;"> The Delhi High Court (HC) has emphasised the need to create ‘guard and dog partnerships’ in consultation with the Police to train stray dogs to protect the housing society and not harm its residents as a part of the rules for stray dogs in society. This would be done in order to make sure that residents are safe from any potential harm that could come from these stray dogs.</h6> <br>

                              <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;">The court has issued directives to citizens, 
                                Resident Welfare Associations (AOA) and municipal bodies regarding the feeding of stray dogs. The court observed that stray dogs must have access to food and water if there are no community dog feeders in the area. It also stated that the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and AOA or the municipality should work closely to create designated feeding spots where humans don’t frequent. This would give the dogs a 
                                sense of security as they are territorial in nature. </h6> <br>
                              <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;"> In addition, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960,
                                 particularly Section 38, provides protection for stray dogs. Dogs cannot be relocated or ejected from their domain in accordance with the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001. Additionally, the Central Government issued an Office Memorandum in 2006 urging employees to refrain
                                 from abusing stray dogs.</h6> <br>

                              <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;"> However, the Delhi High Court’s judgement was briefly overturned by
                                 the Supreme Court in March 2022, largely due to the fact that stray dogs can be fed in housing communities. However,
                                  the ban was lifted in May 2022 with the justification that no citizen could be prohibited from providing stray dogs
                                 with food or water.</h6> <br>





   
   
                                 <h2 style=" color: var(--e-global-color-vamtam_accent_6); text-align: justify; ">What is the role of an AOA in maintaining a gated society with stray dogs?</h2><br>

                                 <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;">AOA are typically responsible for maintaining the housing society. However, 
                                  they may often be unaware of how to control stray dogs inside the area. This can be due to the fact that many residents feed them, 
                                  which ends up increasing the stray dog population within the
                                   gated community. </h6> <br>

                                   <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;">With the approval of the order from HC, AOA now need to focus on
                                     increasing awareness on the subject. AOA can work on better implementation of Animal Birth Control (ABC) to drive 
                                     sterilisation with support from AWBI. Also, the latest draft of ABC for 2022 talks about vaccination and the formation of stray monitoring committees within society. Once passed, AOA will need to undertake activities to ensure the peaceful co-existence of stray dogs
                                     and humans.</h6> <br>
                                   <h6 class="nmn my-2" style="text-align: justify;">Our animal companions are an inseparable part of our lives. With a 
                                    cooperative attitude and thoughtful policies on the part of pet owners, other residents, and management committees, we
                                     can ensure the welfare of furry friends and the
